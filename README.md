## ✨ Features

* **Native Performance:** Built with Swift & SwiftUI. Zero lag.
* **Mouse Avoidance:** The light smartly "dodges" your cursor so you can click buttons in the corners.
* **Customizable:** Adjust width (up to 120px) and color.
* **Presets:** Includes Warm, Cool, Neon, Gold, and Matrix themes.
* **Menu Bar Friendly:** Respects your screen space, doesn't overlap the top menu or Dock.

## 🖥 System Requirements

* **macOS 13.5** or later (Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia, Tahoe).
* Works on both Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) and Intel Macs.
